# Croquettes

## Ingredients

- 250 ml broth
- 250 ml milk (can be substituted with broth)
- 250 g flour
- 60 ml vegetable oil
- 1 Onion
- 1 cup of chicken, chorizo, ham, etc.
- 2 glove of garlic
- 2 tbsp of butter
- Salt to taste
- 2 eggs, beaten
- Breadcrumbs for coating
- Oil for frying

## Instructions

1. In a pan, heat the butter and sauté the finely chopped onion and garlic until translucent.
2. Add the chopped chicken, chorizo, ham, or your choice of filling to the pan and cook for a few minutes until heated through. Set aside.
3. In a separate saucepan, heat until boiling the broth, milk, and vegetable oil.
4. Add the flour to the boiling mixture, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook over medium heat until the dough thickens and pulls away from the sides of the pan.
5. Add the cooked filling to the dough and mix well. Season with salt to taste.
6. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap (make sure the wrap touches the surface to prevent a skin from forming), and let it cool completely.
7. Once cooled, shape the mixture into small cylinders or balls.
8. Coat each croquette in flour, then dip in beaten eggs, and finally coat with breadcrumbs.
9. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pan to 180°C (350°F). Fry the croquettes in small batches until golden brown and crispy.
10. Remove the croquettes with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
