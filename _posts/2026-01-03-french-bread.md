# French Bread

## Ingredients

- 210 ml (3/4 cup + 2 tbsp) warm water
- 1 tsp (4 g) granulated sugar (optional)
- 1/2 tsp (≈2.5 g) active dry yeast
- 320 g (about 2 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp (≈5 g) salt

## Instructions

1. Combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes, or until foamy.
2. Mix the flour and salt with the water mixture and stir until a rough ball forms (no need to knead).
3. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest and rise for 30 minutes.
4. Perform a stretch-and-fold: stretch the dough and fold it toward the center.
5. Lift the dough by the center and slap it down five times.
6. Repeat steps 3–5 once more.
7. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 2 hours, until noticeably puffy.
8. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces.
9. For each piece, flatten, roll, and shape into a small roll.
10. Place the rolls on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
11. Cover with a towel and let the rolls proof for 30 minutes.
12. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
13. Score each roll and spritz water around them to help generate steam.
14. Cover with a deep tray or roasting pan on the oven and bake the rolls on the bottom rack for 15 minutes.
15. Carefully remove the deep tray.
16. Continue baking until the rolls are a deep golden brown.
